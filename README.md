To add recipes to your page, simply click on the `Add Recipe` button. Input the recipe name, website for the recipe, and select type of recipe from the drop-down. Recipe types include breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. Once all these fields are filled out, click the submit button. The app will let you know if you've successfully added a recipe by displaying `Recipe Added!` to the screen.

To view all the recipes you've collected on your app, click on the `All Recipes` icon. This will display clickable cards with the name and image of each recipe. When you find a recipe you like, click on the recipe card and a modal will pop up. From here you can rate the recipe, favorite the recipe, view the recipe, write a comment on the recipe, and delete the recipe.

Quisine also has a search feature. Look up a recipe by its name, type of meal, or rating. The results will display all appropriate recipes cards.
